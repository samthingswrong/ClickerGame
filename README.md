##	Clicker

###  **Description:**

You play as a farmer. Your general goal is to collect eggs. Save up points and buy upgrades to collect more eggs per click.

### **More detailed description:**

Incremental games, also known as clicker games, clicking games (on PCs) or tap games (in mobile games), are video games whose gameplay consists of the player performing simple actions such as clicking on the screen repeatedly. This "grinding" earns the player in-game currency which can be used to increase the rate of currency acquisition. In some games, even the clicking becomes unnecessary at some point, as the game plays itself, including in the player's absence, hence the moniker idle game.
